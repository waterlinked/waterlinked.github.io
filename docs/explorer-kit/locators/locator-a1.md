## Description

The Locator-A1 has the smallest physical footprint in our series of locators. It can be integrated into even the most compact ROVs. The Locator-A1 does not carry its own depth sensor, and the Master-D1 requires that the depth be provided from your underwater vehicle (ROV etc.) This can be achieved by means of the [UGPS API](../gui/api).


## Wiring interface
