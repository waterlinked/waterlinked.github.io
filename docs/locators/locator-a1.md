## Description

The Locator-A1 has the smallest physical footprint in our series of locators. It can be integrated into even the most compact ROVs. The Locator-A1 does not carry its own depth sensor so the Master-D1 requires the depth to be provided from your underwater vehicle (ROV etc.) This is acheived by using the included software API.  Example of how to perform this can be found [here](../explorer-kit/gui/api.md#providing-depth-to-system-when-using-locator-a1s1).
