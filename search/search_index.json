This means it will attempt to obtain an IP address from a DHCP server on the same network. For convenience the DVL supports mDNS to easily discover the assigned IP address. The mDNS name used for the DVL is: waterlinked-dvl . Note If no DHCP server is avaiable on the network, it is recommended to configure a static ip address as the DVL can use up to 5 minutes searching for a DHCP server. Web GUI On operating systems supporting mDNS you can open the web GUI the following URL: http://waterlinked-dvl . If mDNS is not supported you need to obtain the IP address of the DVL and use that in your browser (http://IP_ADDRESS). The web GUI shows the status of the DVL (velocity and altitude) as well as diagnostic information. The web GUI also allows for network configuration. Network config The DVL has two IP configuration options though the web GUI: DCHP client, where it obtains an IP address from a DHCP server on the same network. Static mode where the user sets the wanted IP address for the DVL. Once the IP configuration is modified the DVL needs to be rebooted for the settings take effect. TCP Output The DVL supports sending measurements updates using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). A TCP server is available on port 16171 which outputs the latest measurements to all the connected clients. In the web GUI you can see the number of connected clients and the format of the output message. See description of the output protocol . Software update To get the best performance of the DVL it is recommended to always run the latest software. The update GUI can automatically check if a new software version is available. Automatic software update The easiest way of checking if a new version is available is to connect the DVL to the internet and let the upgrade GUI automatically check for a new version: Connect the DVL ethernet to a network where the internet is available and make sure the DVL network configuration allows access to the internet. Go to http://waterlinked-dvl:9000 or http://IP_ADDRESS:9000. The upgrade GUI will automatically check if there is a new version available and allow installation of new upgrade with a single click. Offline software update If you are unable to connect the DVL to the internet, offline software update is available. The process is: Find the current version and chipid in the the \"about\" section of the DVL web gui Manually download an upgrade package (.wlup) from the update server using the chipid. Verify if the version downloaded is newer than the currently running version Go to http://waterlinked-dvl:9000 or http://IP_ADDRESS:9000. Select \"manual upload\" and then upload the downloaded file. Fallback IP For convenience the DVL will always be available with the static IP address: 192.168.194.95 . To be able to connect to the DVL using the fallback IP address perform following steps: Connect a ethernet cable directly from the DVL to your computer.

The purpose of the system is to give a live GPS position of ROVs, divers and other moving objects below the water surface. The Underwater GPS system is based on Short Baseline (SBL) acoustic positioning. The Locator is placed on the device to be positioned and functions as a beacon that send out an acoustic pulse. Near the surface, there are four Receiver hydrophones lowered into the water. The Receivers listen for the pulse from the locator. Time-of-arrival to each Receiver is used to calculate the Locator\u2019s position. SBL systems, compared to the USBL systems, have the advantage of working well in shallow water and acoustic reflective environments, such as in fish cages, near harbor installations, close to ship hulls, inside water tanks etc. Once the position is known relative to the Receivers, the global position can be found by adding that to the position obtained by a GPS receiver. The Underwater GPS system does that part internally so that it can provide the actual global position of the ROV as it's output.

The steps are: Power the topside unit Calibrate IMU Deploying receivers Connect everything Select locator and channel Configure receiver placement in GUI Power the topside unit Start by connecting power to the topside unit. We do this first because we want the GPS receiver to start receiving signals and acheive a lock while we setup the rest of the system. If you are using the Locator-S1, power it on now so it also have time to get GPS lock. Calibrate IMU Connect the Ethernet cable to the topside unit and your computer. Then open your web browser and type in the IP-address of your topside unit which is defined by the position of the dip-switch on the Master-D1. How to change the IP-address is described here . At the top bar on the GUI you will see a calibration bar for the IMU. To calibrate the IMU rotate it in a figure of 8 and keep doing it until the IMU calibration bar becomes full and green. Deploying of receivers Before starting to deploy the receivers in the water, add a piece of tape on the receiver cable on the desired depth to make setup easier. Place the receivers in the water on the desired location and decide which number (1-4) each receiver will have. This is important when connecting the receivers to the topside unit. Tip Adding lead weights just above the receiver helps keep them stable when doing the positioning. Connect everything When connecting the receiver cables to the topside unit remember the numbering you decided on and connect the connector to the accordingly port. If this is not correct the position will be completely wrong. Next you connect the Locator if you are using the A1 or D1. Select locator and channel Now that everything is connected and ready it is time to select the right locator and choose which channal to listen on. This is configurated on the setting page of the web GUI. The Water Linked standard is to use channel 17 and this is also the default channel for the Locator-S1. Configure receiver placement and seach range in GUI After selecting the correct locator, you need to provide the correct placement of the receivers to the GUI for the positioning to work correctly. This is done by drag'n drop of each receiver to the correct placment relative to the topside unit. The position of each receiver is seen below in the map view. It you click on the receiver you get a pop up with the possibility to write its exact placment. Once this is done you can limit the search range by using the same drag and drop feature. Warning If you are using the Locator-A1 or S1, you need to provide depth information to the topside unit. Description on how to do this is found here . Tip Reducing the search range helps to improve the performance of the system. It is recomended to limith this range if you are operating in a smaller area. This is especially important in tanks.

In order to ensure the best performance, you should follow a few guidelines: Line-of-sight Try to place the Receivers so they all have a free line-of-sight to the Locator. Good Separation The system performs better when there is a decent distance between the Receivers. More separation is better, but 2x2 meters is sufficient for good performance. Max Range There should be maximum of 100m from any Receiver to the Locator Receiver Depth Place the Receivers at a few meters depth. Near the surface there are typically small air bubbles caused by waves. These small air bubbles attenuate the acoustic signal and can reduce the system performance. Limit search area You will get a better position if you help the search algorithm to narrow the search area. Limit the search range setting to the area where the Locator is expected to be. Directivity The Receivers and Locators are fully omnidirectional and transmits/receives equally good in all directions. The only direction with less performance is backwards where the cable enters. Receiver stability Add some weight to the Receiver cable just above the Receiver so they hang straight down in the water On board GPS If the master electronics is static during operation it is recommended to use the static option for the GPS. This is to remove the inaccuracy of the GPS Receiver in global position. Only use onboard GPS when the reference system is moving eg. if mounted to a boat. Reference Systems In order to calculate the absolute position of the Locator we need to define two reference systems, the acoustic and the global reference system. The global reference system is defined by latitude and longitude and is the reference system used by the GPS and in maps. The acoustic reference system (the x and y axis) is defined by the orientation of the housing. The housing is by definition located in origin (x=0, y=0). A label on top of the lid indicates the x-y coordinate system. Boat Example The illustration bellow shows a typical Receiver configuration when installed on a boat. The Receivers are hanging from the side of the boat, one in each corner. The depth of the Receivers are typically 2-4m, deep enough to get below the hull and get free line-of-sight to the Locator.

Terminology Modem - Unit for transmitting/receiving data Packet - Unit of data transmitted together ACK - Acknowledgement. The command issued was successful. NAK - Negative acknowledgement. The command issued failed. Version This document describes protocol/software version 1,0,x (major,minor,patch) The protocol versioning follows semantic versioning in that: MAJOR version increments represents incompatible API changes, MINOR version increments represents added functionality in a backwards-compatible manner PATCH version increments represents backwards-compatible bug fixes Overview The serial communication format is 115200 8-N-1 (no hardware flow control). Packets sent to and received from the modem start with a w and end with end with LF or CR+LF. The packet format is: Start byte Direction Command Options (0 to many) Checksum End byte w c or r x ,[option] *xx \\n or \\r\\n Direction is command ( c ) for commands issued to the modem and the modem replies with direction set to response ( r ). The commands can be sent as a string or entered one char at a time from a terminal. The protocol can support Water Linked modems with different payload sizes and extended features. To support any Water Linked modem the connection procedure is to: Get protocol version. Verify that the major version number is 1. Get payload size. Use this size when queuing packets for transmission the modem. For Water Linked Modem-M64 the payload size is 8 bytes. In order for two modems to communicate they must be configured to use different roles (A/B) on the same channel. The modem with role A will always transmit. The modem will role B will listen until it detects a signal from a modem of role A. It will then start transmitting responses back to the modem with role A. The modem with role B will go back to listen mode if several consecutive packets from the modem with role A cannot be decoded (ie signal is lost). Note Payload where every byte is \\0 is reserved. It is used to keep modems in sync if no data packet is queued by the user. This sync packet is filtered out by the receiver. Avoid this payload by compressing the data or otherwise ensuring atleast 1 bit is non-zero. Checksum is optional when sending commands to the modem. The modem always returns a checksum. The checksum algorithm is CRC-8 and it is formatted as a hexadecimal number using 2 lower-case charaters (ex: *c3 ). Commands Commands in the table are shown without the checksum for readability.
